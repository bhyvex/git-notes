= better than stash

This is better than stash -- you can backup everything on your local repo that
is not already on one of your remotes, plus it includes all untracked files
not covered by the ignore mechanism.

        # better than stash; untracked files also saved
        git commit --allow-empty -m wip-index-state
        git add -A && git commit --allow-empty -m wip-worktree-state

        git bundle create /tmp/sos.bdl --all --not --remotes

        # copy that file wherever you want, however you want...
        rsync /tmp/sos.bdl bkphost:   # or scp, or whatever

        # unstash
        git reset --mixed HEAD^
        git reset --soft HEAD^
