== Basic usage

...using mostly the GUI

**A note to Linux users**:

    Most of the following document is written for Windows.  If you're using
    Linux, you ought to be able to read it and just do the equivalent -- Linux
    has GUI installers that even //find// the software for you, and running
    bash commands is easy as pie, so I'm not going to handhold you lot :-)
