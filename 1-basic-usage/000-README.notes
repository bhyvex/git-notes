== Basic usage

...using mostly the GUI

**A note to Linux users**:

    A lot of this is written for Windows.  If you're using Linux, you ought to
    be able to read it and just do the equivalent -- Linux has GUI installers
    that even //find// the software for you, and running bash commands is easy
    as pie, so I'm not going to handhold you lot :-)
