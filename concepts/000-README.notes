## (READ THIS FIRST) README for this directory

This directory contains individual tips and techniques as separate articles.
These are likely to have more narrative than commands, so they should be good
for concepts and light reading.

In addition, [my take](../gcs/index.html) on the classic "Git for Computer
Scientists" may be useful to get your head around the basic concepts.

Another page that may be useful is [Git from the bottom
up](http://ftp.newartisans.com/pub/git.from.bottom.up.pdf).
