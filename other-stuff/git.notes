  * on tracking content instead of files: http://marc.info/?l=git&m=116473016012824

  * descriptive article on the advantages of a DVCS and speculative branching
    and low overhead repos and so on:
    http://griddlenoise.blogspot.com/2007/12/distributed-vcss-are-great-enablers-or.html

  * on why git is so revolutionary.  This is actually the most "concept-ish"
    of all the praising articles on git, and yet the most tangible because he
    keeps on pumping us with examples of stuff he and others had done which
    could ALL be replaced by git:
    http://www.advogato.org/person/apenwarr/diary/371.html.  Has stuff like "I
    wanted to build distributed filesystem, but git beat me to it; I wanted a
    file backup system, but git beat me to it", etc., essentially saying that
    git is a platform for building whatever you want, not just a VCS.  Or how
    about a "hash indexed backup system" to store backups from different
    systems efficiently?

=== funny stuff

  * http://changelog.complete.org/posts/698-If-Version-Control-Systems-were-Airlines.html
    -- esp the last 2 "airlines".  No wonder I like git so much :-)
