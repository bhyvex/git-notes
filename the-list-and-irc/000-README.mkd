# from the trenches...

This directory contains various snippets, as well as longer, detailed,
articles, from the git list and from IRC.

Some of them will be short and quick howto style notes, while others will be
long, detailed, and very narrative in their style.  Either way, they're pieces
I found particularly helpful.

Acknowledgements will be made (name of author, gmane link of article), and any
Changes [editorial or otherwise] that I make will be made obvious in some way.
