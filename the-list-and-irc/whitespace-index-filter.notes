# fixup whitespace errors

When you have whitespace errors in a repo and want to fix them all together,
here's what you do.  Written by doener circa 2009-07-12 19:23

So let's say the following code is in `~/git-scripts/ws-fix.sh`

    #!/bin/bash

    # from doener (who else!)
    # to be called as an index-filter

    if git rev-parse --quiet --verify $GIT_COMMIT^ >/dev/null
    then
            against=$(map $(git rev-parse $GIT_COMMIT^))
            git reset -q $against -- .
    else
            # Initial commit: diff against an empty tree object
            against=4b825dc642cb6eb9a060e54bf8d69288fbee4904
            git rm --cached -rfq --ignore-unmatch '*'
    fi

    git diff --full-index $against $GIT_COMMIT | git apply --cached --whitespace=fix

Notes:

  * the `map` translates the original sha1 to the sha1 of the rewritten
    commit.  The diff needs to go against the rewritten one, so that the patch
    applies without conflicts/fuzz.

  * run this like: `git filter-branch --index-filter '. ~/git-scripts/ws-fix.sh'`

  * a pictorial representation of what this script does each time it is
    called (also from doener a few minutes later when I still couldn't get
    it!):

        Original:

        A---B---C---D---E

        Rewritten so far: (1 == rewritten A, and so on)

        1---2---3

        To create 4 we do:

        map D^ == map C == 3

        so: git diff 3 D | git apply ....

Other possibilities:

If the whitespace problem causing conflicts is something like indentation
shift, etc., and is not amenable to `git apply --whitespace=fix`, the
following may work.  We assume the "remote" version is the one with the
unnecessary indentation changes:

    git show :1:filename > filename
    git diff -b :1:filename :3:filename | git apply
    # (might need munging; the diff header has :1: and :3: in it...)
    git merge-one-file :1:filename :2:filename $(git hash-object -w filename) filename
